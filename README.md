This Google Chrome extension converts the URL of the current tab of the Chrome browser into a QR-code. To convert the URL the extension uses the [Google Charts API](https://developers.google.com/chart/interactive/docs/reference).

This project was chosen as an introduction to the development of extensions for Google Chrome. And to create a URL-to-QR converter where I would know, whose code is doing the work; useful especially in stricter/confidential work environments.

ToDo:
- create a better icon
- tidy up code
- check URLs/text from the URL-field for special characters and encode them correctly
- use an internal QR-code generator for real offline functionality / may be used behind restricted company proxies.
- display a textfield for custom text-to-QR
